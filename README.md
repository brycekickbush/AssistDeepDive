A deep dive into how assist% and assistRatio leads to team success in NBA seasons and postseasons.

The 2021-22 NBA season was a season to remember for Milwaukee Bucks fans after the Bucks fell to the Celtics in 7 at the Garden. While Giannis put on an incredible show akin to his dominance in the 2020-21 NBA finals, the Bucks offense many times throughout the series felt stagnant. Some compare the modern day Bucks to the spurs free flowing offense which featured an offense filled with playmakers that would spread the ball around arguably the greatest offensive anchor of all time Tim Duncan. Many of the Bucks strenghts in the 2020-21 season felt reminiscent of the Spurs dynasty, but a lot of these strenghts seemed to evaporate when Khris Middlton injured his MCL versus the Chicago Bulls in the first round. Milwaukees fluid half court offense completeley stagnated and it felt like the team only relied on Giannis and Jrue Holidy high pick and roll. Watching the Boston series inspired me to deep dive into ball movement and how it impacts NBA teams in the postseason.
